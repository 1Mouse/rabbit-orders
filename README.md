# Rabbit Orders

A responsive order management interface built with Next.js 16, featuring a data table with search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and a mobile-optimized card layout. Includes light/dark mode support.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js >= 20, pnpm >= 9

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3000/orders
```

## Project Structure

This is a **pnpm monorepo** managed with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build):

### Architecture Decisions

**Feature-based organization** — Order-related code lives in `features/orders/` rather than being spread across generic `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/` directories. Each feature module contains its own model, query state, server logic, and UI components.

**Reusable data table** — The `components/data-table/` system is generic and decoupled from the orders feature. It accepts configuration objects for search, filters, sort, and pagination — making it reusable for any entity.

**Server-side rendering** — The orders page is a React Server Component. Data filtering, sorting, and pagination happen on the server via `listOrders()`. The client only handles URL state management through [nuqs](https://nuqs.47ng.com).

**URL-driven state** — All table state (search, status filter, sort direction, page) is stored in URL query parameters via nuqs. This means every view is bookmarkable, shareable, and works with browser back/forward navigation.

## Features Implemented

### Core Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Order table with ID, Customer, Status, Items, Created At | `order-table-columns.tsx` with TanStack Table |
| Status filter dropdown | `data-table-toolbar.tsx` with status selector |
| Responsive design | Desktop table + mobile card layout (`order-mobile-card.tsx`) |
| Static mock data source | `mock-orders.ts` generates 118 deterministic orders |
| Alternating row colors | Striped rows via `index % 2` conditional styling |
| Empty state message | `data-table-empty-state.tsx` — "No orders found" |
| Clean, maintainable code | Feature modules, typed props, no `any` leaks |

### Bonus Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Search by name or ID | Debounced search input (500ms) in toolbar |
| Sort by date | Toggle button cycling between "Newest first" / "Oldest first" |
| Light/dark mode | `ThemeToggle` component using `next-themes` |

### Additional Enhancements

- **Pagination** — Page navigation with ellipsis for large page counts, "Showing X-Y of Z" indicator
- **Type-safe environment variables** — `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` with Zod validation
- **Shared UI library** — `@workspace/ui` package with Base UI + CVA components
- **Mobile card layout** — Responsive cards below `md` breakpoint, table above

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19) |
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| UI Components | Base UI + Class Variance Authority |
| Data Table | TanStack React Table v8 |
| URL State | nuqs v2 |
| Theme | next-themes |
| Env Validation | @t3-oss/env-nextjs + Zod |
| Build System | Turborepo + pnpm workspaces |

## Quality Standards

### Type Safety

- Strict TypeScript across the entire codebase
- Type-safe environment variables validated at build time with Zod
- Type-safe URL query parameters via nuqs parsers with defaults
- Input normalization (`normalizeOrderListQuery`) clamps and validates all query params

### Code Organization

- Feature modules encapsulate related model, state, server logic, and UI
- Shared UI components live in a separate workspace package
- Data table system is config-driven and entity-agnostic
- Formatters are pure functions extracted for testability

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
pnpm lint          # ESLint across all packages
pnpm format        # Prettier with Tailwind plugin
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript strict mode
```

## Test Suite

Three layers of testing cover the application from pure logic through component rendering to full browser interactions.

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Pure function tests with no React rendering required:

```bash
pnpm test          # Run all unit + component tests (single run)
pnpm test:watch    # Watch mode for development
```

| Test File | What It Covers | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `query-state.test.ts` | `normalizeOrderListQuery` — page clamping, pageSize bounds, search trimming | 8 |
| `order-formatters.test.ts` | `formatOrderDate` locale formatting, `formatOrderItemsSummary` truncation | 5 |
| `list-orders.test.ts` | `listOrders` — filtering by status/search, sorting asc/desc, pagination, edge cases | 10 |

### Component Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)

Render tests verifying component behavior through the DOM:

| Test File | What It Covers | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `order-status-badge.test.tsx` | Renders correct text for all 4 statuses | 4 |
| `data-table-empty-state.test.tsx` | Renders title, description, and icon from config | 1 |
| `data-table-pagination.test.tsx` | Page buttons, disabled states, navigation calls, entity name | 6 |

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Full browser tests against the running application:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e      # Headless Chromium
pnpm test:e2e:ui   # Interactive Playwright UI
```

| Test | What It Verifies |
|---|---|
| Loads and displays orders table | Page renders, heading visible, table rows present |
| Search filters results | Typing a non-match shows empty state |
| Search clears and restores | Clearing input brings back the full table |
| Status filter narrows results | Selecting "New" shows only New-status badges |
| Sort toggles | Button cycles between "Newest first" / "Oldest first" |
| Pagination navigates | Clicking page 2 updates URL and content |

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Unit + component tests
pnpm test

# E2E tests (starts dev server automatically)
pnpm test:e2e

# Everything via Turborepo
pnpm test && pnpm test:e2e
```
